Smart Grid Energy Management System

Overview:

The Smart Grid Energy Management System (SGEMS) is designed to optimize the production, distribution, and consumption of electrical energy. It aims to enhance energy efficiency, reduce costs, and improve the reliability of the electrical grid by integrating advanced metering infrastructure, demand response capabilities, and renewable energy sources.

Key Features:

Live Monitoring: Observe energy usage and generation in real-time.
Adaptive Demand Response: Automatically adjust energy consumption based on real-time demand and supply conditions.
Renewable Energy Integration: Incorporate solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources seamlessly.
Battery Storage Management: Efficiently manage battery storage systems for optimal use.
Consumer Dashboard: Intuitive interface for users to monitor and control their energy consumption.
Forecasting with Predictive Analytics: Employ machine learning to predict energy demand and supply trends.
Alerts and Notifications: Receive notifications about critical events and system status updates.

System Requirements:

Python 3.8+: Ensure Python is installed.
Virtual Environment: Use for managing dependencies.
Flask: Required for the user dashboard.
pandas: Necessary for data analysis and manipulation.
matplotlib: Needed for data visualization.
sklearn: Required for machine learning and predictive analytics.

Setup and Configuration:

Database Settings: Configure database parameters in config.py.
API Key Management: Store API keys for external services (e.g., weather data) in config.py.
Model Training Scripts: Find scripts for training machine learning models in the models/ directory.

How to Use:

Live Monitoring: Use the dashboard to view real-time data on energy consumption and generation.
Adaptive Demand Response: Set up demand response to automatically save energy during peak demand times.
Renewable Energy Management: Add and monitor renewable energy sources via the dashboard.
Battery Storage Optimization: Manage battery storage to maximize energy efficiency and savings.
Energy Forecasting: Utilize predictive analytics to forecast energy needs and adjust strategies accordingly.
Event Alerts: Configure alerts to stay informed about key system events and conditions.

Troubleshooting Tips:

Application Errors: Check logs for detailed error messages.
Database Connectivity: Ensure the database is correctly configured and accessible.
API Access Issues: Verify that API keys are set up correctly and have the necessary permissions.
